    "\n",
    "1. **Nominal data**, which represents categories that do not have a natural ordering. For example: political party affiliation (Democrat, Republican, Other), sex (male, female, other), and computer operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux).\n",
    "1. **Ordinal data**, which represents ordered categories. For example: T-shirt sizes (small, medium, large), Likert-scale responses (disagree, neutral, agree), and level of education (high school, college, graduate school). Ordinal and nominal data are considered subtypes of categorical data.\n",
    "1. **Numerical data**, which represents amounts or quantities. For example: heights, prices, and distances.\n",
