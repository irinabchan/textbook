# Principles and Techniques of Data Science

This is the repository of the adaptation of the textbook for [Data 100, the Principles and Techniques of Data Science course at UC Berkeley][ds100]. This project constitutes of adapting code examples present in the textbook from Python to Julia.

The textbook was originally written by [Sam Lau][sam], [Joey Gonzalez][joey], and [Deb Nolan][deb]. Code adaptation was developed by Irina B Chan under the supervision of [Prof Roger Whitney][whitney].

For information on the Julia modules used for development, please check the [Julia dependencies][julia_dependencies] page.

Data 100 is the upper-division, semester-long data science course that follows
[Data 8, the Foundations of Data Science][data8]. The reader's assumed
background is detailed in the [About This Book][about] page.
